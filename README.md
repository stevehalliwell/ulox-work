# ulox-work
Working through [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/), in Unity C#.

## Why though?
Don't expect this to be used (very much) in production. At least not in the state it is right now. Honestly it was something fun to work through, a pleasent sparetime distraction.

## Status 
![current code coverage](D:\Repos\ulox-work\CodeCoverage\Report\badge_linecoverage.png)
- *CURRENT* Core jlox equivilant implemented in C# inside a Unity project using the TestRunner and Code Coverage to confirm correct behavior and error reporting.

## Pending
- Add implementation related jlox challanges to the interpreter, including tests. 
- Add standard lib equivilant for interpreter.
- Add Unity specific hooks and functions.
